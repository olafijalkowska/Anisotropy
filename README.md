# Anisotropy
Few scripts and classes creates beta and gamma ray distribution emitted form oriented nuclei.
Anisotropy.cc/hh and PrimaryGeneration.cc/hh are designed to be used in geant4 codes.
GammaDistr.cxx is a ROOT script that calculates gamma ray distribution created 
to test geant4 classes.
RandDistrWithPolar.cxx and PlotPolar.cxx are ROOT scripts that calculates beta distribution
emitted from oriented nuclei.
